# testing_day1

Explorer Mode
- Run ruby tests.rb
- Make those tests pass. Of note: do not edit tests.rb.

Adventure Mode
- Write a test for an "Espresso" having a greater affect on a person's alertness (it increases it by 0.4). Don't edit any existing tests.
- An espresso has only one drink in it.
- Make those tests pass

Epic Mode
- Write tests for a Tea class. If a person drinks tea, their alertness increases by just 0.25. So, they might need more than a single serving. Don't edit any existing tests.
- Make those tests pass
